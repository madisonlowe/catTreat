# Cat Treat Randomiser

This is just a little project that I'm building at the request of my sister. She wanted a tiny web app that would let her randomise a treat to give to one of our pet cats, Puddy. So, that's what I'm building!

## Roadmap

This randomiser was built during the first weeks of my coding bootcamp when I was (and still am) getting fully familiar with JavaScript, and CSS and HTML. As such, I'm not going to go beyond those languages in this project, but I'm hoping to see if I can use this chance to practice working with the DOM and building a few nifty little functions.

Right now, it's just a randomiser, and I haven't built the HTML or CSS, so those are my first priorities. Later on, I would like to add a small 'notes' section so that my sister can write up a shopping list of things to get the cat, or I'd like to find or build a cat-themed API to return some facts, information etc. on request to the webpage. Will update this log with my progress accordingly.
