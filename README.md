# Cat Treat Randomiser

This is just a little project that I'm building at the request of my sister. It's a simple webpage built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, that will randomise a cat treat to give to a cat on the press of the button element.

To download and edit, clone this repo into your terminal with `git clone https://github.com/madisonlowe/catTreat.git` or alternatively, click the 'Fork' button at the top of this page and follow the instructions.

As this is written in three basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, there shouldn't be anything to install.

## Roadmap

Upcoming edits:

- Edit CSS to better match `mini_wireframe.png` in the repo files.
- Make mobile responsive.
